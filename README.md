# snake

This is a toy project that implements the classic game snake using the PyGame module

## Running the code
Make sure you are in the project folder and then run:
```
pipenv run python3 game/snake.py
```
an interactive window will pop-up and you can use the arrow keys to control the snake. 

## More ideas for extension:
* hexagonal snake (coming soon! see hex_snake branch!)
* snake with bridges/tunnels? (2.5 dimensional snake)
